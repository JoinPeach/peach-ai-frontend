      "Hi David,\n\nThank you for your interest in the Federal Work-Study program! I am happy to answer your questions.\n\nYes, you are eligible for work-study based on your financial aid package. Your award is $2,500 for the academic year, which means you can earn up to that amount through work-study employment.\n\nTo find available positions:\n1. Visit the Career Services portal at careers.university.edu\n2. Filter by Work-Study positions\n3. Apply directly to positions that interest you\n\nMost positions pay $15-17 per hour, and you can typically work 10-15 hours per week. Your earnings are paid directly to you via paycheck (not applied to your student account).\n\nPopular departments include the library, student centers, academic departments, and administrative offices. I recommend applying early, as positions fill up quickly!\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.\n\nBest,\nPuneet Thiara",
